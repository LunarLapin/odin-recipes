    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I came to appreciate baked potatoes several years ago. Many who enjoy this delicious dish know the difference between a <em>good</em> baked potato and a <em>great</em> baked potato. The crispiness of the skin, the hint of crunchy salt, and the light and fluffy insides are heaven on a plate. Adding a dollop of sour cream, chives, or any other topping of choice on top of the steamy fluff make this a comforting delight.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly-ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat oven to 450 degrees F.</strong> This will help achieve the ideal crispiness</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare baking sheet.</strong> Place potatoes on a foil lined baking sheet</li>
        <li><strong>Poke holes all over each potato with a fork</strong></li>
        <li><strong>First bake.</strong> You'll be baking the potatoes twice. For the first round, bake for 25 minutes or until the skin feels dry and slightly wrinkly</li>
        <li><strong>Brush the potato with melted butter (or oil).</strong> carefully remove from the oven and use a pastry brush to brush with melted butter or oil evenly on all sides. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of Kosher salt. Place back on baking sheet, opposite-side up.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Bake.</strong> Use an oven mit and gently squeeze the potatoes to check if the insides are nice and soft. If they do not seem soft enough, continue cooking in 5-minute increments.</li>
    </ol>
